# Recommendations
Use IntelliJ IDEA. You *can* use other IDEs like Eclipse or NetBeans, but IntelliJ has nice syntax highlighting. It's free too.
# Guidelines
* No spaces between brackets. Example: use `if(cond)` instead of `if (cond)`.
* Please use Javadoc and comments, but use Javadoc whenever you can, to make it easier for other people to understand.
* Use `kebab-case` for filenames, and `camelCase` for variable names. For classes, use `PascalCase`.
* Import stuff using catch-all imports, eg: `import java.util.*;` instead of separately wrtiting `import java.util.Scanner; import java.util.Arrays;`.
* Be nice to people, and don't use rude or offensive words in Javadoc or comments.
* NO AMERICAN ENGLISH!!!!!!!!!
* Use standard British English, but with -ize endings. Note that this doesn't apply to words like 'analyse', which have -yse endings.
